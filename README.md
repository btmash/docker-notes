# Docker notes from the monthly devops meetup

These are our study notes as we go through <a href="https://www.dockerbook.com/">The Docker Book</a>

The notes are set up in slide format and can be viewed at <a href="https://webapp-builders.github.io/docker-notes">https://webapp-builders.github.io/docker-notes</a>.

The main index.html file holds all the content (for now).

## Credits
